# multi-armed-bandit-problem_and_MDP
This repo contains some algorithms to solve the multi-armed bandit problem and also the solution to a problem on Markov Decision Processes via Dynamic Programming. I did this as a part of an assignment for the course on Reinforcement Learning.
All the relevant files are in the folder 'Assignment 1'.
